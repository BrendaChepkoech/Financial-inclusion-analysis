# Financial Inclusion Analysis in East Africa
Financial inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 14% of adults) have access to or use a commercial bank account. In the recent past, there has been a significant growth of innovative fintech solutions like MPESA services.
Our research focuses on how mobile money transactions can lead to greater financial inclusion for people who don't have access to banks. Greater financial inclusion leads to greater access to credit services, and easier tax base to achieve revenues, better access to savings and fintech services.
